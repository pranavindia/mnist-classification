This project classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a neural network implemented with  Keras.
Overview
This project utilizes a simple neural network model to classify the digits 0-9 from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained and evaluated, and the performance metrics are visualized.

Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. It includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images
